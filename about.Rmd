Hi. My name is Thomas E. Love, Ph.D., and I'll be teaching 431 this semester.

```{r fullprof-fig, echo = FALSE, out.width = '20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Love_Headshot_Jan2019.png")
```

- Email is the best way to reach me: I'm at **Thomas dot Love at case dot edu**, and this is on the bottom of each page of this pre-class website.

### I have at least three different jobs.

- I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population \& Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses each year (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.
- I direct the Biostatistics and Data Science group at the Population Health Research Institute and the Center for Health Care Research and Policy at The MetroHealth System.
- For many years, I was the (founding) Data Director for [Better Health Partnership](http://betterhealthpartnership.org/), an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there.

### Name, Pronouns, Social Media

- Professor Love uses he/him/his pronouns.
    - Most students refer to him either as Professor Love or Dr. Love, and he prefers this during class.
    - He prefers his given name to be written "Thomas" as opposed to "Tom".
    - Most of his friends and colleagues call him "Tom". You are welcome to do so, outside of class time, if it makes you comfortable.
- At Github, I am [THOMASELOVE](https://github.com/thomaselove).
    - Github repository for this site [is found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021-preclass).
- My professional Twitter handle is [ThomasELove](https://twitter.com/ThomasELove).

### A Few Other Things

- I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 [John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching](https://students.case.edu/traditions/awards/diekhoff/) from CWRU.
- I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.
- In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.
- I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. 
- I am married to a brilliant attorney and we are in the process of emptying our nest. Our older son just completed his underegraduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, and our younger son begins his second year (but first year in person) at Columbia this Fall. 
- We live in Shaker Heights. I enjoy baseball, golf and several other sports. I also sing and act occasionally in [community theater](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater).

### Office Location(s)

I have an office at CWRU in the Wood building (WG-82J) and an office at MetroHealth Medical Center (Rammelkamp R229A) and also work out of my home. Prior to the start of class, at any rate, I will not be available for in-person office hours, but respond quickly to email.
